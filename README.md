# Description
This project is a web application that helps users find words from a dictionary based on their input word and the edit distance between words. The edit distance is a measure of how many edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) are needed to transform one word into another. The application provides a list of the top 10 words from the dictionary that have the smallest edit distance to the input word.
